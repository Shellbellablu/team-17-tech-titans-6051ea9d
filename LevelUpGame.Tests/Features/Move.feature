Feature: Move
    I want to move my character. If they attempt to move past a boundary, the move results in no change in position but does increment move count.

Scenario Outline: Move in a direction
    Simple example of how to test move

    Given the character starts at position with XCoordinates <startingPositionX>
    And starts at YCoordinates <startingPositionY>
    And the player chooses to move in <direction>
    And the current move count is <startingMoveCount>
    When the character moves
    Then the character is now at position with XCoordinates <endingPositionX>
    And YCoordinates  <endingPositionY>
    And the new move count is <endingMoveCount>
    Examples:

        | startingPositionX | startingPositionY | direction | startingMoveCount | endingPositionX | endingPositionY | endingMoveCount |
        | 0 | 0 | NORTH | 103| 0 | 1 | 11 |
        | 0 | 0 | SOUTH | 32 | 0 | 0 | 33 |
        | 0 | 0 | EAST | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
        | 0 | 0 | WEST | 67 | 0 | 0 | 68 |
        | 0 | 9 | NORTH | 57 | 0 | 9 | 58 |
        | 0 | 9 | SOUTH | 3238 | 0 | 8 | 39 |
        | 0 | 0 | EAST| 45 | 1 | 9 | 46 |
        | 0 | 9 | WEST | 25 | 0 | 9 | 26 |
        | 9 | 9 | NORTH | 58| 9 | 9| 59 |
        | 9 | 9 | SOUTH | 83 | 9 | 8 | 84 |
        | 9 | 9 | EAST | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 |
        | 9 | 9 | WEST | 4 | 8 | 9 | 5 |
        | 9 | 0 | NORTH | 768 | 9 | 1 | 69 |
        | 9 | 0 | SOUTH | 35 | 9 | 0 | 36 |
        | 9 | 0 | NORTH | 768 | 9 | 1 | 69 |
